Banking System in C++ (Console-Based)
Overview
This is a simple console-based Banking System implemented in C++. It allows users to:
•	Register an account
•	Login
•	Deposit money
•	Withdraw money
•	Check balance
•	View transaction history
This version is online-compiler-friendly, using an in-memory storage system (unordered_map) instead of file storage.
Features
•	User Registration & Login: Users can create accounts and log in.
•	Deposit & Withdraw: Manage funds with simple commands.
•	Check Balance: Displays the current balance.
•	Transaction History: View a history of deposits and withdrawals.
•	No File Dependencies: Works seamlessly in online C++ compilers.
How to Run
1.	Open an online C++ compiler.
2.	Copy and paste the code into the compiler.
3.	Compile and run the program.
4.	Follow on-screen instructions to register, log in, and manage accounts.
Notes
•	Data is not saved after the program exits.
•	If you need persistent storage, consider using file handling or a database.
Future Improvements
•	Implement file storage for persistent data.
•	Add security measures like password encryption.
•	Introduce multi-user banking with admin access.
•	Develop safety measurements (e.g, implementing 2FA.)
